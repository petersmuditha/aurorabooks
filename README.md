# Aurora Books Chatbot

An AI-powered customer support chatbot for Aurora Books, an online bookstore based in Italy.

## What it does

The chatbot answers customer questions based on the official FAQ documentation, using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture. It does not invent answers. It only responds using the provided knowledge base.

## Live Demo

The chatbot is deployed online and accessible here:

https://aurorabooks.onrender.com/docs

You can test the POST ask endpoint directly from the browser.

Note: the service runs on Render Free tier. If it has been inactive for more than 15 minutes, the first request may take 1 to 2 minutes to wake it up.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- FastAPI for the web service
- LangChain for the RAG pipeline
- Cohere for the embeddings model
- Groq API for the large language model
- ChromaDB as the vector database
- Uvicorn as the ASGI server

## Project Structure

aurorabooks
  docs
    faq.txt           the knowledge base documents
  api.py              the FastAPI web service used online on Render
  main.py             the terminal chatbot used locally on your PC
  requirements.txt    the list of Python libraries
  .env                your API keys never uploaded to GitHub
  .gitignore          files to exclude from Git
  README.md           this file

## How it works

1. The documents in the docs folder are loaded and split into chunks.
2. Each chunk is converted into a vector using Cohere embeddings.
3. The vectors are stored in ChromaDB.
4. When a user asks a question, the system finds the most relevant chunks.
5. These chunks are passed to the LLM together with a system prompt.
6. The LLM generates an answer based only on the provided context.

## Features

- Retrieval Augmented Generation for accurate answers
- Citation enforcement, the chatbot must cite the source document for every statement
- FastAPI web service with interactive documentation
- Cloud deployment on Render
- Environment variables for API keys, no secrets in the code

## API Endpoints

- POST ask accepts a JSON body with a question field and returns the chatbot answer
- GET health returns the service status useful for monitoring

## Setup

Follow these steps to run the project on your computer.

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/petersmuditha/aurorabooks.git
   cd aurorabooks

2. Create a virtual environment

   python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment

   Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   macOS and Linux
   source venv/bin/activate

4. Install the dependencies

   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Create a file named .env in the project root with your API keys

   OPENAI_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_key_here
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key_here

   Get a free Groq key at console.groq.com
   Get a free Cohere key at dashboard.cohere.com

6. Make sure your documents are inside the docs folder as txt files

7. Run the web service locally

   uvicorn api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

8. Open the browser at

   http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

   Use the POST ask endpoint to ask a question

## Running the Terminal Version

If you prefer to chat with the bot directly from the terminal use main.py instead

   python main.py

Type exit to quit

## Example Questions

- How much does shipping cost
- How can I return a book
- Do you offer gift cards
- What payment methods do you accept
- Do you have a loyalty program

The project is deployed on Render.

Build Command

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command

   uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Environment Variables required on Render

- OPENAI_API_KEY
